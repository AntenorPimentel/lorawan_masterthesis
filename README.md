## LORAWAN AS ENERGY SAVING ALTERNATIVE FOR  OBJECT TRACKING SENSOR  NETWORKS ON THE INTERNET OF THINGS IN  SMART CITIES

### Abstract
Low-power wide-area networks have been developed to serve machine-to-machine
communication, providing long-range communication and low energy consumption,
since traditional wireless sensor networks face various constraints in smart cities.
This thesis investigates whether LoRaWAN o↵ers an energy-ecient alternative to
currently used cellular networks for object-tracking sensor networks. This is done by
means of a simulation in discrete-event simulator CupCarbon, in which a real-case
scenario of the Dublin Bus tracking system is set up. LoRaWAN and cellular
networks are applied to the same scenario, and energy consumption in terms of data
communication between sensors and gateways is recorded. A quantitative analysis
shows that LoRaWAN consumes significantly less energy in data communication
than cellular networks in a scenario of location-tracking for moving sensors. An
independent t-test provides a result of t(39) = 22.1062, with p < 0.01. Secondly, the
thesis determines which LPWAN in Europe— LoRaWAN, Sigfox or NB-IoT— has
received the most academic attention in terms of power consumption. A systematic
review shows that research focusing on LPWANs has increased substantially in
recent years. LoRaWAN is the LPWAN studied most with regard to energy
consumption, with a total number of 179 articles compared to 86 for Sigfox and 89
for NB-IoT. The results of this thesis show that applying LoRaWAN on a smart-city
level can make smart cities more energy ecient and provide a means to decrease
power consumption globally while enhancing the development of Internet of Things.
